## How it works
When roblox closes, roblox sounds replaced with yours custom. Also this creates a copy of sounds in case you want to return your old ones back.
## FAQ
> Can I be banned for this?

No. Roblox does not ban players for modifying local files, if they did I would warn you.
<br><br>
> Can I get old sounds back?

Yes. Read below.
<br><br>
> Is there virus code here?

No. You can see for yourself by looking at source code of the project.
<br><br>
> I ran `robloof.exe` but nothing happened!

Actually happened. Check your tray (icons at the bottom right of the screen).

## Setup
1. **[Download AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-install.exe)**, .
2. **[Download project zip](https://github.com/Zgoly/robloof/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)**.
3. Unzip zip to any place, for example, to your desktop.

## How to use
Just run `RoblOOF.ahk` and program will run and create `config.ini`.

Now, after each closing of Roblox, program will change your sounds to new ones.
