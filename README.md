## ❓ How it works
When roblox closes, roblox sounds replaced with yours custom. Also this creates a copy of sounds in case you want to return your old ones back.

## 🤔 FAQ
### - Can I be banned for this?

No. Roblox does not ban players for modifying local files, if they did I would warn you. If you don't believe, read [this](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/1333413).

### - Can I get old sounds back?
Yes. Read [this](#how-to-use).

### - Is there virus code here?
No. You can see for yourself by looking at source code of the project.

### - I ran `robloof.exe` but nothing happened!
Actually happened. Check your system tray.

Now, after each closing of Roblox, program will change your sounds to new ones.
That is, after checking for updates, Roblox *closes* and change sounds to yours.

## ℹ️ About `config.ini`
In `config.ini` you can configure some settings:
- `roblox_name` - the name by which the application will identify roblox. Default - `Roblox`.
- `sound` - sound that will play when sounds change successfully. Default - `\*64`.
  - You can change this sound to...
    - `0` - Don't play a sound
    - `\*-1` - Simple beep. If the sound card is not available, the sound is generated using the speaker.
    - `\*16` - Hand (stop/error)
    - `\*32` - Question
    - `\*48` - Exclamation
    - `\*64` - Asterisk (info)
  - Also, you can change it to custom sound. All you need to do is specify the path to the sound. Example:
    - *Drop sound `wow.mp3` into folder with program*
    - Instead of default `\*64`, specify value `wow.mp3`
- `backup_folder` - folder in which backup of roblox sounds will be stored. Default - `backup`. If you don't want to create a backup, set the value to `0`.
- `sounds_folder` - folder, where the sounds you want to change to are stored. Default - `sounds`.
- `roblox_versions_folder` - path to folder with roblox versions. Default - `(Your local AppData folder)\Roblox\Versions`.
